ARDrone-Matlab
==============

This matlab coding source is aiming to control the Parrot ARDrone with Microsoft XBOX Kinect.
- Matlab-based ARDrone Communication and Control function
- Kinect object-based RGB colour tracking (based on RGB image)
- OpenNI Libarary enable kinect that provides depth image for real world coordination convertion

### ARDrone control function
- Connect to AR.Drone via wi-fi
- Compiling the "drone_main.m" file in Matlab (Press F5)
- OFF YOU GO

### Kinect Function
Contains compiled codes of mex-files that utilitzing the Microsoft Kinect and OpenNI 1.* libary.
Using the Microsoft Visual Studio (Express) Gcc (x64) C++ compiler
This Mex-codes are only working with Matlab 64bit, Windows, dependant on the System ability

OpenNI requirement of version 1.* install: 
- OpenNI 1.5.4.0 
- NITE 1.5.2.21 
- SensorKinect093 v5.1.2.1

MATLAB release	 MATLAB 7.12 (R2011a)
Requirements	AR.Drone v1.7
